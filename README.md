A web application built with ASP.NET Core that leverages AI to generate unique recipes based on the ingredients selected by the user. The recipes are generated through API calls and can be saved to a database for future reference.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Recipe Generation**: Select ingredients, and the AI generates creative recipes tailored to your input.
- **Database Integration**: Save recipes to your account for future access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design to make recipe discovery fun and easy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Cohere API Key](https://cohere.ai/) (required for recipe generation)
- A database (e.g., SQL Server or another supported by ASP.NET Core EF Core)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-recipe-generator.git
   cd ai-recipe-generator

         "ApiKey": "Your_API_Key"  }
     ```

3. **Restore dependencies**:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:

   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` under `ConnectionStrings`:

         "identityDatabase": "Your_user_info_database"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Apply migrations to set up the database schema:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
